# BossFight

This is a small project starter project made during my summer 2022 internship as a SDE.
I was assigned to it just to familiarize myself with C# and the Agile methodology.
Its a very basic turn based RPG fight style game.

Its the first thing I ever programmed in C# so it isn't great code and its not completely finished.
